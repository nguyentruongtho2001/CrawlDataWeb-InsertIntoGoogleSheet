# CrawlDataWeb-InsertIntoGoogleSheet
Abstract: This project automates URL validation using Selenium. It checks the page content of each URL; if an error is found, the result is marked as "Failed," otherwise as "Pass." Results are then uploaded to Google Sheets via the Google Sheets API with Google OAuth2 authentication.
